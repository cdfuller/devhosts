# Project Handoff

## Current State of the Project
The project is currently in the planning phase. The Product Requirements Document (PRD) has been written, but no code has been implemented yet. The goal is to develop a CLI-only Go application focused on managing local development environments effectively.

## PRD Summary
The application will provide command-line tools to manage local hosts entries and integrate with Caddy for local HTTPS development. Key features include:
- Managing `/etc/hosts` entries to add or remove local domain mappings.
- Generating and updating Caddyfiles for local development servers.
- Providing a simple and intuitive CLI interface for ease of use.
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility where possible.
- Handling permissions and security considerations when modifying system files.

The scope is limited to CLI functionality with no frontend or web-based UI components.

## Decisions Made
- Chose Go as the development language for its performance, concurrency support, and ease of deployment as a single binary.
- Decided to integrate with Caddy by generating and managing Caddyfiles to streamline local HTTPS setups.
- Focused on directly managing `/etc/hosts` to control local domain resolution.
- Opted for a modular code structure to facilitate future enhancements and maintainability.
- Emphasized simplicity and reliability in CLI commands and user experience.

## Guidance for Next Developer/LLM
- Begin by reviewing the PRD to understand the project goals and requirements.
- Set up the Go development environment and establish the initial project structure.
- Implement core CLI commands for managing `/etc/hosts` entries safely, considering permission elevation where necessary.
- Develop functionality to generate and update Caddyfiles based on user input.
- Include thorough error handling and logging to aid debugging and user feedback.
- Write unit and integration tests to cover key functionalities.
- Document CLI usage and configuration options clearly.
- Plan for cross-platform considerations, especially regarding file paths and permissions.
- Coordinate with any system administrators or users to validate changes to system files.
